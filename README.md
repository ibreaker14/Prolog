## Part One: Dell Logic Puzzles
### Content:
#### 1. tie.pl
This program solves the dell logic puzzle "It's a Tie":
> Four colleagues recently got into a discussion about some of the flamboyant pat-terns showing up on neckties these days. As a joke, each man arrived at work the next day sporting the most ridiculous tie he could find (no two men wore ties with the same patternâ€”one tie was decorated with smiling cupids). None of the men had to venture outside of his own closet, as each had received at least one such tie from a different relative! From the following clues, can you match each man with the pattern on his flamboyant tie, as well as determine the relative who presented each man with his tie? 
> * The tie with the grinning leprechauns wasn't a present from a daughter. 
> * Mr. Crow's tie features neither the dancing rein-deer nor the yellow happy faces. 
> * Mr. Speigler's tie wasn't a present from his uncle. 
> * The tie with the yellow happy faces wasn't a gift from a sister. 
> * Mr. Evans and Mr. Speigler own the tie with the grinning leprechauns and the tie that was a present from a father-in-law, in some order. 
> * Mr. Hurley received his flamboyant tie from his sister.

#### 2. friends.pl
This program solves the dell logic puzzle "Imaginary Friends":
> Grantville's local library recently sponsored a writing contest for young children in the community. Each of four con-testants (including Ralph) took on the task of bring-ing to life an imaginary friend in a short story. Each child selected a different type of animal (including a moose) to personify, and each described a different adventure involving this new friend (one story de-scribed how an imaginary friend had formed a rock band). From the following clues, can you match each young author with his or her imaginary friend and determine the adventure the two had together? 
> * The seal (who isn't the creation of either Joanne or Lou) neither rode to the moon in a spaceship nor took a trip around the world on a magic train. 
> * Joanne's imaginary friend (who isn't the grizzly bear) went to the circus. 
> * Winnie's imaginary friend is a zebra. 
> * The grizzly bear didn't board the spaceship to the moon.

#### 3. star.pl
This program solves the dell logic puzzle "Star Tricked":
> Last week, four UFO enthusiasts made sightings of unidentified flying objects in their neighborhood. Each of the four reported his or her sighting on a different day, and soon the neighborhood was abuzz with rumors of little green men. By the weekend, though, the government stepped in and was able to give each person a different, plausible explanation of what he or she had "really" seen. Can you deterine the day (Tuesday through Friday) each person sighted a UFO, as well as the object that it turned out to be?
> * Mr. Klatu made his sighting at some point earlier in the week than the one who saw the balloon, but at some point later in the week than the one who spotted the Frisbee (who isn't Mr. Gort). 
> * Friday's sighting was made by either Mr. Barrada or the one who saw the clothesline (or both).
> * Mr. Nikto did not make his sighting on Tuesday.
> * Mr. Klatu isn't the one whose object turned out to be a water tower.
